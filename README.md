# Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Detection (Deep Learning)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing deep learning techniques to detect multiple retinal diseases such as **Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**.  
The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture for binary classification of retinal fundus images into **"Disease"** or **"Non-Disease"** categories.

## ðŸ”¹ Highlights
- Data preprocessing and augmentation of retinal fundus images  
- Encoder-decoder based deep neural network for classification  
- Achieved robust performance in distinguishing diseased vs. healthy fundus images  
- Practical application in healthcare diagnostics
